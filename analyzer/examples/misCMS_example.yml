        # -1 ... Can be used as a signal or background to train a MVA
        # -2 ... For data, will not participate in the tree decision but will be evaluated and used for kolmogorov tests (as soon as this part will be developped) 
        # -3 ... Will not be used for MVA training, but will be evaluated and passed along  
        # -4 ... Cannot be evaluated (This code will mainly be used to decide whether the branching process has to be stopped. tmva will NOT check by itself whether this code is present.)
        # 0 ... Will be trained on, considered to be a background (given here for completeness: this code is used by tmva, and using it here might cause the tree-building strategy function to produce unexpected results).
        # 1 ... Will be trained on, considered to be THE signal (given here for completeness: this code is used by tmva, and using it here might cause the tree-building strategy function to produce unexpected results).
