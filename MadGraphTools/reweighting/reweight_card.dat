#
# Reweighting by Leading Order (tree-level / loop-induced) matrix
# elements
#
# Caution: this is not (in general) NLO accurate, even when starting
#          with NLO accurate events.
#
# Note: 
#   1) the value of alpha_s will be used from the event so the value in
#      the param_card is not taken into account.
#   2) It is (in general) dangerous/wrong to change parameters by a large
#      amount, if this changes the shape of the matrix elements a lot.
#      (For example, changing a particle's mass by much more than its
#      width leads to very inaccurate result). In such a case, separate 
#      event generation runs are needed.
#
#
# Example of (standard) code for the computation of two weights:
#
# launch                    ! tag to start the computat'n of the first weight
#  set BLOCKNAME ID VALUE   ! rule to modify the current param_card
#  set BLOCKNAME ID VALUE   ! rule to modify the current param_card
# launch                    ! start to compute a second weight
#  /home/Cards/param_card_2.dat ! you can also enter a path to a valid card
#
#
# Possible options: 
#   You can enter one of the following lines to customize the reweighting 
#   procedure. These need to be given before the 'launch' command.
#
# change model NAME : use another model for the matrix-elements to reweight 
#        with. In this case you need to provide the path to a correct 
#        param_card for the new model; you cannot modify the original one 
#        with the 'set' command.
# change process DEF [-add]: change the process by which you reweight. 
#        The initial and final state particles of the new process should 
#        be exactly identical to the ones in the original process.
# change helicity False: perform the reweighting by helicity summed 
#        matrix-elements even if the events have been written with a 
#        single helicity state.
#
